                            <p>Grief is a deeply personal and often isolating experience. We were challenged to explore how technology could offer a new form of support. Instead of trying to literally "bring back the dead," we focused on helping the living. GriefVR is a 15-minute guided VR therapy session designed to help young adults navigate their grief. It provides a safe, private space to process complex feelings and work towards acceptance in a controlled, supportive environment. This project was a M3 project within Creative Technology at Utwente.

                            <p class="video-description"> GriefVR isn't a one-size-fits-all experience. It starts by asking how you're feeling, then personalizes your session. You'll move through three rooms in a specific order tailored to your current emotional state. These rooms include a guided meditation space, a creative room for self-expression, and a place to gently revisit a memory with your loved one, who is represented abstractly. This tailored approach ensures the experience is supportive, not overwhelming.</p>

                            <p>Our solution was to build a supportive tool, not a digital ghost. The core of GriefVR is its adaptive system. By asking how the user feels at the start, it customizes the session's flow to be genuinely helpful and relaxing, the idea of simply 'reviving' someone in VR was not the goal.</p>

                            <h2>Results</h2>
                            <p>The goal was to create a safe, private, and comfortable VR experience to help people through grief. This project could be the start to show what VR can bring to creating personalized, emotionally meaningful experiences. It was a valuable lesson in designing technology for mental health, forcing us to balance innovation with a deep sense of responsibility.</p>
